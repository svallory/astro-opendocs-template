Welcome to the **Astro OpenDocs Template**! This guide will help you get up and running in minutes.

## 1. Quick Start

This template is designed to be used as a GitHub Template.

1.  Navigate to the [astro-opendocs-template](https://github.com/svallory/astro-opendocs-template) repository.
2.  Click the **"Use this template"** button.
3.  Choose **"Create a new repository"**.
4.  Clone your new repository and run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## 2. Configuration

Open `astro.config.mjs` to customize your site:

```javascript
export default defineConfig({
  site: 'https://your-site.com',
  integrations: [
    starlight({
      title: 'Your Site Name',
      // ...
    }),
  ],
});
```

## 3. Modular Middleware

One of the unique features of this template is the **Modular Middleware**. You can find it in `src/middleware/`.

To enable/disable features, edit the `sequence` in `src/middleware.ts`:

```typescript
export const onRequest = sequence(
  schemaHeaders, // Handles .schema.json content-type and CORS
  // ...
);
```

## 4. Custom Components

This template comes with components ready to use in your MDX files. Check out the [Components Reference](/reference/components/) for details.

## 5. Smart Linking (Auto-Base Path)

If you deploy your site to a subpath (e.g., GitHub Pages), you usually have to worry about prefixing all your links with that path. 

**This template handles that for you.** You can use standard root-relative links in your Markdown, and our custom Remark plugin will automatically prepend the correct base path during build:

```md
<!-- This will automatically become /astro-opendocs-template/reference/components/ -->
Check out our [components](/reference/components/).
```
