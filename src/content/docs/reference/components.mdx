This template includes several pre-built components to help you build beautiful documentation.

## TeamMemberCard

The `TeamMemberCard` is perfect for showcasing your project's contributors or leadership.

### Example

<TeamMemberCard
  name="Saulo Vallory"
  role="CTO at Toki Labs | Social Alchemist"
  bio="Senior Software Engineer and Architect with 20 years of experience. Driven by the power of technology to transform lives and thrive in complexity."
  avatar="https://saulo.engineer/images/portrait.jpg"
  github="svallory"
  website="https://saulo.engineer"
  twitter="svallory"
  location="Global"
/>

### Usage

```astro
import TeamMemberCard from '../path/to/TeamMemberCard.astro';

<TeamMemberCard
  name="Name"
  role="Role"
  bio="Bio description..."
  avatar="/path/to/avatar.png"
  github="username"
/>
```

## JsonSchemaViewer

A React-based component to visualize JSON schemas effortlessly, powered by Stoplight.

### Example

(Coming soon: Add an example JSON schema to your `public/` folder to see it in action!)

### Usage

```astro
import JsonSchemaViewer from '../path/to/JsonSchemaViewer';

<JsonSchemaViewer
  name="User Schema"
  schemaUrl="/schemas/user.schema.json"
/>
```

Note: This component requires React integration (enabled by default in this template).
